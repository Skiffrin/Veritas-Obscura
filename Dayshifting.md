It was Monday—the old man who ran the gig I worked at, who made the job just a little less unbearable and in general was a kind-hearted person—had passed away. His replacement? Ruthless. Unforgiving. The type who dished out punishment as swiftly as clockwork.

So, I decided to pack my things and leave.

Now I was lay on the couch, staring at the ceiling. My long purple hair cascaded over the edge, brushing against the floor. It was clear as day that procrastination wouldn’t get me far. I needed a job—and fast.

"But what are my options?"

That thought elicited an exasperated sigh from me. The idea of finding another crappy job, repetitive and mind-numbing enough to suck the soul out of you, made my teeth clench. Ridiculous. Unfair. Life felt like a series of endless decisions that led nowhere. And I couldn't keep pretending that everything was fine.

The silence in the room pressed down on me, and I hated it. I hated feeling so... stuck. I could feel my  facade slipping.

I would love to just continue lying down on the couch and let everything pass by. But this was not an option, that's for sure.

I pulled myself upright, suddenly sick of the quiet. My fingers gripped the fabric of the couch, the same way they’d curl into fists if I didn’t find something to do. I needed a cigarette. Something to calm the damn fire inside me.

But no. I had to figure this out.

I stood up, pacing around the room. Maybe Kay’s store was hiring. Or maybe I’d end up applying somewhere else, somewhere that didn’t remind me of my mistakes every time I walked in the door.

I dragged my fingers through my hair, frustrated by how slow I was at figuring things out. It wasn’t like I had all day to waste.

And then the anger hit me again—the same cold rush that made my jaw tighten, the kind that made me want to slam something, anything, to feel something other than... helpless.

Shit.

Maybe it wasn’t just about finding the job. Maybe it was about trying to *control* something, when everything felt so damn out of control.

Nevertheless, I need to move it-to at least give it a try. I got a job once, I can do it twice.

Once dressed up, I took a deep breath. 

What's the worst that could happen, right?

...The bus wheezed to a halt, its doors hissing open. I stepped out, relieved to escape the cramped space where everyone was packed together like a game of human pinball.

My first stop was a small café wedged into the corner of the block, looking out of place among the towering skyscrapers and looming flats. Its windows were fogged over, the smell of burnt coffee and syrup wafting out every time someone opened the door. A handwritten "HELP WANTED" sign was taped to the glass.

Inside, the air was stiflingly warm. I approached the counter, where a young woman with tired eyes was ringing up a customer. When she turned to me, her face didn’t even register boredom—just exhaustion.
 
"Can I help you?" she asked flatly.
  
"I saw the sign. Are you still looking for help?" I asked, trying to sound neutral. 
  
She gave me a once-over, like she could sense I hadn’t worked in food service a day in my life. "You’d have to talk to the manager," she said, jerking her thumb toward the back. "He’s in the office, but he’s kinda busy right now." 
  
I nodded, my fingers curling into the edge of the counter. 

“That’s fine. I can wait.”

“Suit yourself,” she said, turning her attention back to the register.
I sat down behind one of the tables near the door, trying not to look too out of place. Ten minutes passed. Then twenty. By the time the manager finally emerged—a wiry man with a perpetual scowl—my so-called righteous enthusiasm has been snuffed out.

"You the one asking about the job?" he said, crossing his arms. 

"Yeah," I replied, stepping forward.

"You got experience?"

"No, but—"

"I see."

My jaw tightened as he cut me off. The words 'don’t snap' looped in my head like a mantra. “I’m a fast learner,” I said, forcing the words out evenly. 

He grunted. “We’ll call you if we’re interested.” 

I stared at him for a moment before nodding curtly and leaving. The cold air hit me as I stepped back outside, biting against my cheeks. I shoved my hands into my pockets, walking aimlessly down the street. 

*Why bother putting up a sign if you’re going to blow people off?

***

The next place wasn’t any better. A small bookstore. The woman behind the counter barely looked up from her phone as I approached. 

“We’re not hiring right now,” she said, cutting me off before I could even open my mouth. 

I clenched my fists in my coat pockets, biting down on the sharp remark sitting on my tongue. 

"Thanks anyway," I muttered, spinning on my heel. 

The next place wasn’t far—an office building with a squeaky-clean glass doors and a sterile lobby. A sign taped to the window advertised an opening for "Entry-Level Administrative Assistant." It sounded tolerable. Paper-pushing, maybe answering a phone or two. Not glamorous, but quiet.

I stepped inside, smoothing my coat. The air smelled faintly of hand sanitizer and fresh coffee. A receptionist behind the counter looked up, her smile sharp and practiced, like it had been drilled into her.

"Can I help you?"

"Hi, uh," I cleared my throat, already regretting this. "I saw the sign about the job?"

"Right, the assistant position," she said, nodding. She grabbed a clipboard from the counter, sliding it toward me. "You’ll need to fill this out. Once you’re done, you’ll meet with Mr. Collins."

The clipboard felt heavier than it should have as I picked it up, my eyes scanning the form. Name, address, prior experience, skills—it all blurred together.

The receptionist was already back on her computer, typing away with mechanical efficiency. Her nails clicked against the keyboard, reminding me of court stenographers. Around the room, people moved with purpose—polished shoes against tile, clipped conversations into phones, a steady hum of printers in the background.

Everyone here seemed to know exactly what they were doing, their lives running on a precise clockwork schedule. They were cogs, perfectly fitted into the machine. And me?

I shifted my weight, gripping the clipboard tighter. I did not belong here.

They’d ask questions I couldn’t answer. Why I left my last job. Why I had gaps in my employment history. What I’d bring to the team. I’d fumble, stumble, weigh them all down.

I could already picture the disappointment, the awkward silences. My chest tightened, and the room felt colder despite the hum of heaters in the background.

"Everything okay?" the receptionist asked, looking up briefly.

"Yeah," I said quickly, forcing a smile. My hand trembled as I set the clipboard back on the counter. "Actually, never mind. Sorry for wasting your time."

Before she could say anything, I turned and pushed through the door. The cold air outside hit me like a slap, but it was easier to breathe out here.

*God, they’re like cogs in a machine.* I shoved my hands into my coat pockets, my pace quickening. *I’d just weigh them all down.*

By the time I reached Kay’s store, my nerves were frayed and my patience nonexistent. My scarf, still tight around my neck, felt like a noose. 

I pushed the door open, glancing towards the counter.

Kay's not here.

The store was pretty much empty without the presence of its quirky cashier. A lone customer walked along the aisles, their footsteps echoing against the floor. I was thinking of leaving, before the backroom door swung open.

"Relax, I’m here," Kay said, brushing past me with a box in her arms. She looked up just long enough to give me one of her usual grins. "What, couldn’t go a day without seeing me?"

"Yeah-yeah, sure." I rolled my eyes.

She simply continued grinning, stocking the fridges beside me with fresh milk. "What's the special occasion, then?"

"Job hunting," I said.

Kay stopped mid-motion, staring at me like I’d spoken a foreign language. "You? Looking for a job? I didn’t think you’d stoop to _our_ level."

I frowned. "Don’t be ridiculous. Do you need help here or not?"

She shook her head, clearly fighting back a laugh. "So you’re serious. Alright, give me a second. Let me deal with this first."

Before I could reply, she turned to the lone customer—a middle-aged man clutching a bag of snacks. "Find everything alright?"

"Yeah, just these," the man mumbled, sliding his items across the counter, as Kay returned to her usual spot on the chair behind the counter.

Kay scanned them with practiced ease, exchanging casual small talk with him. I leaned against the counter, watching as she handled the transaction with a mix of professionalism and her usual sarcasm.

"Receipt?" she asked, holding it out before he even answered.

The man blinked, shook his head, and shuffled off toward the door, mumbling something polite.

"Good talk," Kay muttered, turning back to me. "Now, where were we? Oh, right—you want me to stick my neck out for you."

I straightened. "I wouldn’t call it that."

She smirked. "I would. Look, Rin, I can vouch for you, but you’ll owe me."

"How much?"

"Not money," she said, rolling her eyes. "A drink. You owe me a drink."

I blinked, caught off guard by the request. "That’s... random."

"Fair’s fair," she said, shrugging like it was no big deal. "Besides, this is basically charity work. At least make it worth my while."

"How...noble." I sighed, pulling a pen from my pocket. "Fine. Where’s the form?"

Kay handed me the paper with a grin. "Knew you’d come around."

As I filled out the application, she leaned on the counter, watching me with that familiar amused look. For once, I didn’t feel the urge to glare at her.

When I handed the form back, Kay glanced over it, nodding. "Alright. I’ll pass this along. Don’t make me regret it, okay?"

"I’ll try not to," I muttered, heading toward the door.

"Hey, Rin," she called, stopping me just before I left.

I turned back, raising an eyebrow.

"You still owe me that drink," she said, her grin teasing but light.

For some reason, I felt the corners of my mouth twitch upward. "Yeah, yeah."

"And you know what? Let's go this evening." She propped her elbow on the counter. "I see no need to postpone it. I will message you the ideas I have in mind later."

"Today?" My eyes widened just enough to be noticeable, which elicited another grin from Kay. 

"Yea, sure, why not?" She answered nonchalantly. "Unless you've got better plans, of course."

"I'll see what I can do." I said, trying to keep my tone neutral.

I stepped out into the cold, as the door closed behind me.

Is this the difference that I sought? Or am I simply trying to escape something?
