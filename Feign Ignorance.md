The laptop screen glowed harshly in the dark, painting the walls in pale, ghostly light. I was hunched over the desk, blankly staring at the empty search bar with my fingers hovering over the keyboard.

I typed out the words again: "Greymoor tragedies." Yet I hesitated; I wasn't sure I wanted to see the articles hidden behind a single press of *Enter*. I sighed shakingly; I couldn't live with my curiosity unsatiated. I might as well go insane, but the truth needs to be known. 

At first — nothing. A factory fire, a car accident, even a haunted house story. I rolled my eyes and scrolled, heart pounding. Maybe this was a mistake.

Then, halfway down the page, a title stopped me cold:

*"Two Found Dead in Their Own Home, Only the Child Survives."*

The title was all-too familiar—I slowly clicked the link. It loaded slowly, like cursed; each second only amplifying my fear.  

It was short, yet it recounted events with horrible detail:

"*West Greymoor police are investigating a suspected murder-suicide after two individuals were found dead in their residence late Sunday night. Authorities identified the victims as 39-year-old A. Kitsuki and 42-year-old V. Kitsuki. Investigators report that A. Kitsuki sustained fatal stab wounds, allegedly inflicted by V. Kitsuki, who is believed to have died shortly afterward by suicide.*
*A neighbor's emergency call led police to the scene. Their 16-year-old child, R. Kitsuki, was discovered unconscious and transported to a local hospital in stable condition.*

**The investigation is ongoing, and no further details have been released at this time."**

The words sat there, stark and cold, staring back at me. I read the article once. Then twice. I could feel my heart beating faster and faster with each reread. *Murder-suicide.* The term felt distant, indifferent, like something you’d read in a crime novel or hear about on TV—not something that could ever touch my life. But the names...

*Kitsuki.
R. Kitsuki.
...me.*

The connection felt impossible to deny, yet my mind rebelled against it. I couldn’t remember. No matter how hard I searched the corners of my memory, all I found was a heavy, mind-consuming void.

I leaned back, light-headed. The room was too quiet, the laptop's hum too loud. Why can’t I remember? What else have I forgotten?

I started looking further, searching through the archives of our local court. My father's name, my mother's — nothing. On a whim, I entered mine.

And there it was. A court case report, sealed, hidden away by the ruling of the court. Why was that? What had taken place in that court that even the public wasn't allowed to know? *What about...me? Why couldn't I remember?*

Fueled by a strange, frantic energy, I began filling in the unseal request. The keys bent under my fingers, and minutes later, it was sent for review.

"Do I even want to know what's inside? I've only began getting my life together..." I muttered, hiding my face in my cold hands.

I shut the laptop abruptly, its glow extinguished like the snap of a trap. The darkness that followed was suffocating, but I couldn’t bring myself to turn the light on. Instead, I sat there, gripping the edges of the desk as if it were the only thing anchoring me.

Sleep didn’t come easy that night—not that I expected it to. The article replayed itself in my mind, the words searing into me, haunting me. 

I found myself staring at the ceiling, my mind chasing threads that refused to come together. The clock on my bedside table ticked, its rhythmic beat an unwelcome reminder of how long I’d been lying there. 1:00 a.m. became 2:00 a.m., then 3:00 a.m.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. I dragged myself out of bed, my legs unsteady beneath me as I padded to the bathroom. The cool water I splashed onto my face felt sharp, jarring me from the worst of my panic, though it did little to silence the storm raging inside.

By the time the first rays of dawn began to filter through the blinds, I was still wide awake. My limbs felt like lead, my mind clouded with exhaustion. Yet, somehow, I forced myself to get up and start the day.

The morning air was cold as I stepped outside, the kind of chill that clung to your skin and seeped into your bones. I pulled my coat tighter around me, my breath fogging in front of me as I walked.

The streets were quiet, save for the occasional car passing by. My eyes stung from lack of sleep, but I didn’t care. I needed to keep moving, to distract myself from the thoughts threatening to consume me.

When I reached the store, Kay was already there, leaning against the entrance with her usual lazy grin.

“Rinny! You’re early,” she said, her breath puffing out in little clouds.

I tried to smile at the sound of an old nickname, but it felt alien, like it might shatter under the weight of my thoughts. “Yeah, couldn’t sleep."

Kay raised an eyebrow, clearly about to pry, but something in my expression must have stopped her. “Well, c’mon. Let’s get you settled in before the morning rush.”

The warmth of the store was a small comfort against the biting cold I’d left behind. It smelled faintly of floor cleaner and freshly stocked produce, an oddly calming mix. Kay flicked on the lights, and the store's interior came alive, aisles stretching out in neat rows under the fluorescent glow.

She handed me the apron, and I pulled it over my turtleneck, hanging my coat on a rack beforehand. The fabric was stiff and slightly oversized, but it was functional. The small embroidered logo on the front marked me as part of the staff, something I still wasn’t used to.

“So,” Kay began, her tone light, “you’ll start with stocking shelves. It’s easy enough, and it keeps you out of the line of fire until you’re ready to deal with customers.”

“Line of fire?” I echoed, half-joking, though my voice was duller than I intended.

“Retail, Rin. The battlefield of the underpaid and overworked.”

I only shrugged, unable to muster up a smile at the joke.

***

Stocking shelves turned out to be mind-numbing, repetitive work—just what I needed. With a cart full of items and a clipboard in hand, I wandered up and down the aisles, matching products to their designated spots. My thoughts still strayed to the article, but the task at hand kept me grounded, at least for a while.

But the case report... I couldn't keep my mind away from it. What was in it? Why did it have my name in it? What would I tell Kay—

The sharp clink of glass against metal startled me, pulling me from my spiraling thoughts. I froze, clutching the jar of pickles I rearranged God-knows-how-many-times, and looked up at the source of the sound.

It was Kay, leaning against the end of the aisle with a bottle of sparkling water in hand, her brow furrowed. She’d apparently been watching me.

“You’ve been standing there, like... staring into space, for the past five minutes,” she said, her voice a mix of concern and teasing: I couldn't tell which was more prevalent.

I blinked, feeling a cold sweat trickle down my back. Had it really been five minutes? My grip on the jar tightened. "Sorry, just... tired, I guess," I muttered. It sounded unconvincing, even to me.

Kay didn’t look away. “Tired, huh?” she echoed, her tone light but probing. She was trying to give me an out, but the knowing look in her eyes said she wasn’t buying it.

I turned back to the shelves, pretending to adjust a row of jars. "Yeah. Just didn’t sleep great last night."

“Rinny,” she said softly, her voice dropping the playful edge.

That name again. It made me flinch, a reflex I tried to suppress but couldn’t quite hide. I didn’t turn around. “D-don’t call me that...”

“Why not?” she asked, taking a step closer. “I used to call you that all the time in high school. You didn’t mind then.”

I paused, the words catching in my throat. Of course, I hadn’t minded then. Back when things were... simpler. Before everything fell apart. I placed the jar back on the shelf, slowly and deliberately, as if I could rearrange my thoughts with the same care.

“We're not students anymore,” I said, forcing my voice to stay steady.

Kay sighed, but she didn’t push further. “Okay. Sorry,” she said, though she didn’t sound particularly sorry. “But... if you’re tired, maybe you should sit down for a bit. Take a breather?”

I wanted to argue, to insist that I was fine, but the tightness in my chest made it impossible to muster the energy. I didn't want to lie. I turned to her, managing a small, put-on smile. “Don’t worry about me,” I said, waving her off.

She watched me for a long moment, her expression unreadable, then gave a slow nod. “Okay. But don’t think for a second I’m letting this go. We’re having a proper talk about whatever’s going on with you, Rin. Soon.”
I didn’t answer, pretending to be engrossed in re-organizing the pickle jars. The truth was, I didn’t know how to respond.

But as the silence stretched between us, I couldn’t help but feel a strange mix of emotions. Kay’s pushiness was grating, but it was also... grounding, in a way. She cared, and even if that scared me, it also meant I wasn’t as alone as I thought.

The weight of the sealed case report lingered in the back of my mind, suffocating any sense of solace her concern might have offered.

The rest of the shift passed in a blur. I occasionally fended off lost customers or manned the register when Kay was somewhere...else.

***
The soft glow of the streetlights casted long shadows of me on the damp pavement as I left the store, instinctively shivering against the cold. Retail wasn't hard, just monotonous, and yet, my thoughts were elsewhere—the article attracted my mind like a magnet.

I just couldn't get my mind off of it. *Murder-suicide?*

It felt like a lie.

I paced quietly along the streets; my boots were crunching the last of the leaves. I couldn't help myself but to light another cigarette. The sounds of the city felt muffled, like I wasn't even there.

By the time I unlocked the door to my apartment, my hands were shaking—not from the cold, but from something I couldn’t name. I didn’t even bother turning on the lights, the faint glow of the laptop on my desk pulling me in like a moth to a lamp.

I hesitated before sitting down. It was still there, the article haunting me from the screen. I’d kept the court case archive tab open, the request screen grayed out with a bold *Submitted for Review* stamped across the top. I stared at it, willing it to change, as though my demand alone could speed up the process.

Hours ticked by. I forced myself to eat something, I am not even sure what I ate. The world outside my window darkened, and the noise of the city declined to faint echoes.

And then, just as I was about to shut the laptop and give up for the night, a soft chime broke the silence.

The email notification popped up in the corner of the screen. My heart leapt into my throat as I clicked on it, the faint tremor in my hands making the mouse wobble.

The chime of the email notification jolted me upright, my pulse quickening as I clicked on it.

***

**Subject:** Request Accepted  
**Body:** Your request to unseal the court case report associated with case #12-34791-X has been approved. Please visit your local courthouse with a valid photo ID to collect the document.

***

I stared at the words, letting them sink in. My initial shock was replaced by a wave of disbelief.

“Visit the courthouse?” I muttered to myself. That didn’t make sense. Requests like this were supposed to take weeks, even months, to unseal—assuming they got approved at all. And yet, here it was.

I reread the email twice, then a third time, as if doing so might uncover some hidden clause explaining how or why this had gone through so quickly. But there was nothing.

Confusion clawed at the edges of my thoughts. Did they make a mistake? 

The knot in my stomach tightened. The idea of walking into a courthouse, of standing at a desk and asking for a file with my name on it, sent an icy shiver down my spine. Yet the promise of answers beckoned, pulling me toward a truth I wasn’t sure I wanted to face.

I closed the laptop, my hands trembling slightly. Tomorrow, I would go. I would walk into that courthouse and collect the file. Collect the truth.

But tonight, I sat in the darkness of my apartment, the faint hum of the city outside pressing in around me.

Even as exhaustion weighed heavy on my shoulders, sleep felt like a distant prospect. My thoughts circled the same question over and over:

*Why was it so easy?*
