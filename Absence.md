The dawn breaks, and the golden rays of our star invade my bedroom.
I opened my eyes. Today's just another day, full of hope that something will finally change, finally add a streak of color to this monotone life of mine.
I got out of bed, leaving the comfortable warmth behind.
...
The bell rings.
The textbooks and notebooks were picked up from my sketched-on desk and shoved into my bag. I left the classroom before the corridors would be filled with the usual chaos once more.
Outside, I headed to the flower shop, and as always, I bough violets - it's was tradition at that point.
...
As I climbed the familiar, fenced hill, I looked up.
It's going to rain soon.
Two rows further. Third column.
There they were.
I knelt down, and placed the flowers for my only friends - my parents.
I did not cry, no - I shed all my tears three years ago. I swiftly stood up.
I quietly sighed, almost imperceptibly in the rain that has already begun.
...
Sitting in the dim, silent room, my fingers trailed over the worn fabric of the armchair. Outside, the rain gently tapped on the windows, but inside—the world was still, like a held breath. 
Ha... if I were to close my eyes, it's almost as if they were still here, as if I could see them sitting beside me, laughing at my terrible jokes. But there was a fog around the memories, like an unfinished dream. I didn’t remember the end. I should—I know I should. There’s this gap where everything just…stops. People said they were gone, that they “passed,” but no one ever explained exactly how. And whenever I tried to picture it, my mind slides over the details, like trying to grasp smoke. Maybe it was an accident, a sickness—everyone had different answers, answers that blurred together, too tangled to unravel.
Three years. People said time makes things easier, that time helps wounds close; I was bleeding still. It's strange, really. I couldn't imagine that the world could feel so small, so claustrophobic. 

...




The rain continued to strike against the window as I 'indulged' into the silence of my apartment, empty and hollow as ever. I sat for a while, just breathing in the quiet. My eyes fell to the worn revolver on the table, its weight an anchor in this blurry reality. The metal is cold to the touch as I pick it up, feeling the familiar weight settle into my hand. For a moment, I just held it, my fingers tracing the edges. I don’t feel sad, nor angry. Just…tired.

I've been running in place.
Looking for answers that do not exist for questions irrelevant.
Trapped within a shadow of my former self.
Unsure if the memories I hold onto are even true.

I raised the gun, feeling its cold press against my skin.
The rain outside had grown louder.

The strike of the hammer, the fiery explosion, the smell of gunpowder is what I longed for. Yet I hesitated.

A single tear slipped down my cheek.
[[Buried]]
