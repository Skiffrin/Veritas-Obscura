I stirred from my nap on the couch, the room already swallowed by darkness. 

Groggily, I grabbed the clock from the shelf nearby, squinting at the faintly glowing digits. The numbers blurred into tiny, indistinct dots. I sighed, fumbling for my glasses where I’d carelessly left them earlier. As I slid them on, the smudges of light immediately gained focus:  9:42 PM. Not terribly late, but it might as well have been the middle of the night. 

I rubbed my face, pushing myself upright. The silence in the house was broken by my annoyed sigh—I'd fallen asleep. Again. Now I needed to find something to pass the night. 

Maybe a cup of tea could help, something to warm the body and soul. With that thought I headed to the kitchen. After some scrambling for the light switch, the bulb above me flickered for a bit, then settled into a steady glow. I got the kettle, filled it with water, and set it to boil. As the soft hum filled the surrounding, I opened the drawer for look a teaspoon. Or maybe tea bags. My fingers brushed over mismatched utensils, the faint clinking of metal oddly soothing against the kettle's hum.

Then my hand felt something else—something thin, soft, and papery.

I pulled the paper free. Maybe it's a note I left and forgot. Or a receipt from the store Kay works in. 
Yet, as I flipped it over, it was as if I already knew what it was.

A photograph, a little worn and creased, the edges were curled, probably from all the time it spent laying there, forgotten. My parents stared at me, the expressions are something between faint smiles and tired wariness. I was sandwiched between them, awkwardly smiling with all the might the younger me could muster. 

I blinked, my gaze drifting back to my father. His hand rested on my mother’s shoulder, but something about the gesture felt… wrong. It should’ve been comforting, but instead, it looked forced. Stiff. My chest tightened, an unexplainable ache spreading low in my stomach.

**Fake.**

I bit my lip, squeezing the photo lightly. It crinkled, creased a little more under the pressure of my fingers. *Why do we look so wrong? Why does my **father** look so wrong?* 
I felt...angry. I didn't even know why. Heat rose to my face, and before I knew it, my fist clenched around the photo. The sudden motion startled me, and I froze, looking at what I've done. Their faces were now contorted; the creases etched deep.

I hastily tried to smooth out the photo on the counter. But the photo was already ruined.
I didn't even realize that my lip had started bleeding. 

"I am sorry," I muttered under my breath, hiding the photo back into the depths of the drawer, as though putting it away would soothe the ache. Did I apologize just to make myself feel better? They're not coming back; the *real* me isn't coming back either. My chest still felt tight and the silence of the kitchen suddenly pressed down like a weight.

I need air. Fresh air. Clear my head maybe.

I grabbed my coat and scarf from the hook near the door, the soft clink of the kettle’s steam-release valve following me as I stepped outside. The tea was not worth it anymore.

I pulled the scarf tighter around my neck as the chill of the night air bit into my skin. I wandered aimlessly along the quiet streets. I don't need to think right now.

*It'll only make it worse.*

When I reached the bridge, I slowed to a stop, leaning against the railing. My breath formed small clouds that vanished almost as quickly as they appeared, like brief apparitions. With trembling fingers, I pulled a crumpled pack of cigarettes from my coat pocket, tapping one loose.

The lighter sputtered before the flame caught. I cupped it against the wind, lighting the cigarette and inhaling deeply. The smoke burned my throat, warm and bitter, but the sensation was almost comforting. My chest tightened, but this time, it wasn’t from anger—it was the nicotine settling in.

I gripped the cold metal railing, focusing on the cigarette between my fingers. The ash grew with each shallow inhale—a remined that the march of time never falters. Slowly, my breathing steadied. The anger from earlier felt distant now, like a shadow slipping away under the glow of the city lights.

“You need to get a grip,” I muttered under my breath, the words trailing off with the smoke that curled into the air. Saying it aloud felt a little ridiculous, yet it did break the silence surrounding me.

I flicked the ash over the edge of the bridge, watching it disappear into the darkness below. The city lights shimmered on the water’s surface, distorting and forming ridiculous shapes. I let my gaze wander for a bit. The night city is beautiful, to say the least. A fiery maelstrom of colors and sounds.

It's lonely. But I guess that's fine.

The tightness in my chest loosened ever so slightly.

It didn’t matter how much I wanted to escape, to soar far away from all of this. Some things are too heavy to carry.

*Maybe not everyone is destined to soar in the sky.*
