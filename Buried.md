I woke up again, as the oh-so familiar rays of light filled my room. I found myself sprawled out on the floor, the gun beside me as a reminder of the events the day before. Of course, I did not shoot myself. I cannot. I groaned, feeling the ache settle into my bones as I pushed myself up. For how long was I lying on the ground?

Sleeping on the ground isn't ideal, but it wasn't new for me, either. I rubbed my neck as I felt the stiffness settle in. I stretched my back, felt a few joints pop, and went to the bathroom.
Routine is relaxing in a way. Brush my teeth, rinse, wash my face. The same, every morning.

In the kitchen I poured some cereal into the bowl, then the milk. What's the point of arguing what goes first if the result will be the same? After spooning the tasteless cereal and throwing the bowl into the sink, the empty fridge reminded me that I need to go to the store.  

As I grabbed my overcoat, which was perfect for the weather outside, I pushed the door open.
The bare, skeletal forms of trees perfectly displayed autumn's surrender. A group of kids outside wrapped in mismatched scarves and jackets were kicking around the leaves, which minutes ago were raked into a perfect pile. 

Turning the corner, the store building greeted me with its already-desaturated flyers of ads and 'exciting new deals' plastered all over the windows.

As I pushed open the door, the warm air of the store enveloped me like a blanket. Kay looked up from behind the counter, setting her phone down. 

"Back again?" she asked, slightly amused. "What are you buying today?"

"Just the usual." I replied, walking towards the aisles. She always had a way of sounding like she was both interested and indifferent at the same time—which probably came with her cashier job: something to pass the time and earn a buck, nothing else.

The fluorescent lights buzzed constantly, casting a pale glow on everything in the store. I grabbed a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese. I looked at the soup cans. The ones I bought had gotten more expensive. I sighed, and grabbed the ones on a shelf below—some off-brand slop. But it will work.

As I placed the items into my basket, I felt a prickle at the back of my neck. It wasn’t anyone watching, just that persistent sense of unease that never seemed to leave me anymore. Shaking it off, I made my way to the counter.

As I placed the stuff on the counter, Kay smirked. "Daring today, are we?"

I smiled wryly. "Living on the edge." I nodded towards the soup cans. "Had to take these instead."

"You know, those taste like cardboard, right? Actual cardboard might be cheaper."

"Cheaper is the goal," I replied. "Not better."

"You've set your bar even lower, huh."

"Been low for years, nothing new."

She didn’t reply this time, just gave me that look—the one that lingered like she wanted to ask something. But she didn't.

"Fair." She dropped, punching the price in. "That'll be ten seventy-eight."

A crumpled bill and a bunch of coins were placed on the counter.

"*Take care, Rin.*" She handed me the bag. 

It...did not sound casual, the way people say 'good morning' or 'bless you' on daily basis without giving it much thought. She said it like she meant it.

"You too." I nodded.

The bell on the door bid its own farewell as I stepped back into the chilling air.

The walk home was rather uneventful. The grocery bag felt heavier than usual—but so had everything else. I tightened my grip on the bag. Once I go to bed, it'll be all over again. Wake up. Brush my teeth. Rinse. Wash my face. Get breakfast.

It wasn't much, but it's mine to control.
*Right?*
I can always- 

I saw something shimmer in the cold sunlight at the base of an oak tree. 
A knife, huh. Its blade was sticking out of uneven dirt. I awkwardly crouched down, setting aside my groceries. People lose things every day. Upon closer inspection, it looked like a neatly-made knife. It wasn't just a kitchen knife you'd find in your drawer. 

"Some soap and polish and you'll be as good as new." I muttered to myself.

A knife is a knife.

Sliding it into my coat, I stood up, grabbed the bag, and continued home.

As I unlocked the door and pushed it open, the familiar and somewhat welcoming silence was already waiting for me. No wind whistling about, no ruffled leaves, no barking dogs.

I kicked my shoes off, hanged my coat(taking the knife with me) and paced to the kitchen. Unpacking the groceries was, well, nothing interesting, as everything had its own spot. Milk on the top shelf of the fridge, bread on a shelf below. The soup cans were placed in the cupboards, the faded labels blending in the shadows.

Now that I dealt with the groceries, I could take a better look at the knife. I pulled it out again, the blade catching light, despite the dirt smudging the blade. I grabbed rag out of the cupboard and wiped it clean, the motion strangely satisfying. I brought the edge to my eye. 

"Sharp enough."

Finders keepers, and I am the finder here. And this is a very good find. I slid it into a small compartment where I kept all the tools and utensils. It fit right in, as if it was always there.

I looked at the clock. It was time. I grabbed the prepared container of crumbs and scraps, and opened the door to the balcony. The crows were already perched on the trees nearby, cawing, talking between each other.

"You remember." I smiled softly. They, too, had their own routine, and I was glad to be a part of  it.  
A tossed a handful of crumbs on the pavement below, watching the birds descent to peck and jostle.
I held out my hand with some too. Maybe one of them is brave enough to accept this offering. 
I stood still, palm outstretched. Slowly, one crow scurried forward, its glossy black feathers gleaming in the sunlight. It was a bold move for the bird—closer than the others, closer than I could expect.
I exhaled softly, not to scare the crow away. It eyed my palm intently, then hopped a little closer, pecking at my palm. The sensation was peculiar—delicate, soft, yet I could feel the sturdiness of the beak. 

"Nyx." I murmured, as the bird hopped away, joining the others. Will he remember this? Or will I lose the bird to the constant flow of time? Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. But in that moment, it felt right.

As the cold wind reminded me to go back inside, I gave the birds a last, quick glance, before retreating into the darkness of my house. There was nothing to do for the moment, so I plopped on a couch, closing my eyes.

For now, it was enough.
