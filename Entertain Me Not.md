My phone lit up with another notification, illuminating the entirety of my bedroom. I didn't need to look to already know what it was: another place idea to hang out at from Kay; another cheerful nudge. I stared at the message preview for a second too long, my thumb hovering over the screen before I locked it again. Not yet. If I opened it, she’d see the telltale *read*, and I, laying on my bed eyeing at the ceiling, wasn’t ready to answer.

What could I even say? *“Sure, sounds fun”*? Too fake—that doesn't sound like me at all. *“I’ll think about it”*? That's basically a decline in disguise.

And then her words echoed in my mind again: *“Unless you’ve got better plans.”*
Yeah, right. Nothing beats lying on my bed, staring at a ceiling all day long, as time slowly marches on; a constant reminder that I need to answer sooner or later.

Still, the thought of her voice—light, teasing, and annoyingly warm—stuck with me, looping like a broken record. What was that about? Why did she care enough to push like this?

But wasn’t this what I wanted? A sign of change, or *difference*, as I’d so dramatically put it to myself. Then why was it so hard to take even one step forward? 

"God—"

Fine. I could not just act as if I did not owe her for helping me with the job. I will go there, and prove to myself I can be more than a complete shut-off, self-loathing myself to death in my dread-inducing house.

The screen lit up once more: 
*"Don't make me hunt you down. ;)"*

I stared at the winking emoji feeling personally attacked. She was relentless. And maybe—just maybe—that was the whole point.

With an involuntary sigh, I unlocked my phone and sent her a reply: "Fine, pick one yourself and let me know."
I hit send before I could talk myself out of it, tossing the phone onto the cushion beside me. The reply felt neutral enough, almost disinterested. It was the best I could manage without lying to her or myself.

The phone buzzed almost instantly. My heart did a weird, fluttery thing I chose to ignore.

"*It's on the intersection of the Highbridge and Fordham, a small cafe. Don't make me drag you out of your house now!*"

Not too far, actually. I still had time to convince myself to go—or to fold.

I peeled myself off the couch, heading to the closet. Its doors creaked as I opened them, revealing an uninspiring lineup of clothes that hadn’t seen much use in... well, a while. I grabbed a random hoodie and brought it up to the mirror. The reflection stared back, pale and disheveled, the hoodie doing absolutely nothing to fix the problem. "I look like a walking corpse." I muttered, though even a corpse would probably look more alive than me.

Tossing the hoodie aside, I rummaged through the mess until my fingers brushed against a familiar texture. The black turtleneck. I pulled it out, smoothing the fabric. The overcoat came next. Its weight on my shoulders was reassuring, and the muted gray gave just enough polish to counterbalance the lingering hollowness in my expression. It wasn’t fancy, but it was better. I slipped it on, and for a second, I almost looked *normal*, haha... 

I took a quick glance at the balcony before taking my leave: the crows were nowhere to be seen; I just wanted to see them again next spring. 

The streets were colder than I expected. The late-autumn air bit at my cheeks as I walked, hands shoved deep into my coat pockets. Leaves crunched underfoot, scattered remnants of the season clinging stubbornly to the pavement.

The intersection wasn’t far, but every step felt like a battle. My mind raced with possible outcomes. Would Kay be there early, leaning casually against the café’s entrance? Or would she wait inside, pretending she hadn’t been checking the door every five seconds?

I only sighed; a white cloud of condensation quickly escaped my mouth, disappearing in an instant.

The café came into view, its warm interior lights spilling onto the sidewalk. I hesitated by the door, adjusting the scarf I’d thrown on as an afterthought. My reflection in the glass stared back at me, all nerves and second-guessing. I took a deep breath, and pulled the door open.

The café wasn’t crowded, but it was loud enough to mask the sound of my hesitating footsteps as I walked in. The door chimed softly behind me, and the warm air hit my face, carrying the scent of freshly brewed coffee. Kay sat by the window, her face bathed in the pale afternoon light. She was scrolling on her phone, absently stirring a cup of something frothy.

She looked up; her expression a mix of both surprise and satisfaction.

"Well, well—look who's here." She announced with one of her usual grins.

I wove past the tables, sliding onto the chair across from her. "Hey."

“Hey,” she replied, leaning back in her seat. Her hoodie peeked out from under her jacket, giving her an extremely casual look that only she could pull off. "I am pleasantly surprised I didn't need to send a search party after you."

"Thought I should spare you the trouble."

"How sweet of you." Her smirk was awfully disarming, so the best I could do is roll my eyes.

Suddenly, her expression turned serious, and she leaned in. "I've been meaning to ask you something for a while now...Where the hell have you been?"

I bit my lip, glancing down at the table. "Been...busy." The truth is—I cannot give her a proper answer, even if I wanted to. It felt like trying to navigate in a fog.

"Oh please." It was her turn to roll her eyes. "Busy doing what? Nobody just disappears for three years, no goodbye or anything, and reappears like nothing happened." 

As I looked up at her, I felt something else in her expression. Hurt, maybe? Or was it wariness? 

"You can't just leave your best friend behind like that, Rin. Not me."

That sentence felt like a sucker punch. It suddenly got hard to breath, the air between us thick with tension. "I didn't mean to," I said, quietly. "I just didn't know how do I-"

She held up her hand, cutting me off. "Rin. I know you had a lot to go through, and I am not here to lecture you. But- I missed you, y'know?"

The vulnerability in her voice was palpable, and it threw me off. Her expression was something warmer, something...real. 

"I missed you too." I uttered, the words foreign, but true.

She smiled. "Good. You are not getting rid of me yet."

The barista returned with my drink, and the moment lightened. Kay took a sip of her coffee, her grin slipping back into its familiar, mischievous shape. “Oh, right! I almost forgot. Congrats—you got the job.”

I blinked. "What?"

Kay simply shrugged, as if she didn't just drop a bomb on me. "It was a no-brainer, to quote my manager. Someone needs to stock the shelves as well keep the store clean on my shifts. So yeah—you're part of the team now."

"You could've told me that before-" I grumbled.

"And to miss that stupefied expression of yours? No way." She leaned back in her chair, taking another sip of her latte. "Guess I'll be seeing more of you now."

“Lucky me,” I said, rolling my eyes, but there was no real bite to the words.

Kay laughed, the sound filling the small space between us. “You gotta believe it. But seriously, don’t disappear on me again, okay? I mean it.” 

“I won’t,” I said, the promise settling somewhere deep within me. “I’ll try.”

"Well, you better!" She stood up and gave me a quick smirk. "See you next Monday, yeah?"

I gave her a quick nod. "Of course."

I watched as Kay disappeared into the fading afternoon crowd, her usual energy still echoing faintly in my mind. The guilt crept in again as I turned away. Three years of silence. Three years of absence.

I could apologize all I want, but I thought I didn't deserve forgiveness.

The faint glow of the streetlight crept into the bedroom, spilling over the edges of the curtain. I’d left it slightly opened—partly for the light, partly for the sound of the city life outside. A way of distracting myself from the dreadful silence this house was well-acquainted with.

I shuffled beneath the covers, begging for sleep to claim me, but my thoughts were like sand slipping through my fingers. Restless. Chaotic. Kay’s words still lingered in my head: *“Don’t disappear on me again.”* They weren’t meant to hurt, but they did. Because they made me think of how much I’d already disappeared—from her, from myself, from the truth.

The truth. That was the word, wasn’t it?

I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to shut out the images that followed. My parents, their faces sharp and blurred in the same memory. It felt like they were just behind a wall I couldn’t break through, taunting me with fragments too small to make sense of.

"I *need* to remember," I whispered into the dark. The words left my lips unbidden, and the sheer weight of them settled had my chest constrict. Remember what? That my parents had died? That I’d been left behind? None of that was news to me. It was the gaps that terrified me—the questions left unanswered, the sealed-off pieces that my brain refused to explain. Why couldn’t I remember?

I threw off the blanket and swung my legs over the edge of the bed. My laptop sat on the desk, the screen dark but accusing. I stared at it for a long moment before finally standing. If sleep wasn’t coming, I might as well do something. Anything.

The screen lit up, its cold light stabbing into the dim room. I didn’t hesitate this time. My fingers moved quickly, typing the first words that came to mind: *“Greymoor tragedies.”*
